                "description": "The choice of typeface is foundational in setting the tone of your design. Serif fonts, with their classic appeal, lend a touch of elegance and formality, making them ideal for print media and official documents. Sans-serif fonts, on the other hand, project a modern and clean look, perfect for digital platforms. When selecting a typeface, consider the message you wish to convey and the medium through which it will be communicated."

Use different font sizes, weights, and styles to differentiate between headings, subheadings, and body text. This hierarchy not only improves readability but also adds visual interest to your next future design."

However, don’t shy away from experimenting with different alignments in headings or callouts to add dynamism to your layout."
